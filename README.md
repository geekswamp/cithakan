# Cithakan ðŸ§±

[Cithakan] comes from the [Javanese language], meaning "**Template**". This project is a collection of templates designed to accelerate [Flutter] application development by leveraging the power of [Mason].

## Installation

Ensure that  you have [Mason] installed before using Cithakan. If not, install it with the following command:

```bash
dart pub global activate mason_cli
```

Then, add Cithakan to [Mason] by running:

```bash
mason add <BRICK_NAME> -g --git-url https://github.com/geekswamp/cithakan --git-path bricks/<BRICK_NAME>
```

For example:

```bash
mason add bloc -g --git-url https://github.com/geekswamp/cithakan --git-path bricks/bloc
```

Available bricks:

- [bloc](https://github.com/geekswamp/cithakan/tree/main/bricks/bloc)
- [data_source](https://github.com/geekswamp/cithakan/tree/main/bricks/data_source)
- [di (dependency injection)](https://github.com/geekswamp/cithakan/tree/main/bricks/di)
- [env](https://github.com/geekswamp/cithakan/tree/main/bricks/env)
- [failure](https://github.com/geekswamp/cithakan/tree/main/bricks/failure)
- [model](https://github.com/geekswamp/cithakan/tree/main/bricks/model)
- [modules](https://github.com/geekswamp/cithakan/tree/main/bricks/modules)
- [network](https://github.com/geekswamp/cithakan/tree/main/bricks/network)
- [repository](https://github.com/geekswamp/cithakan/tree/main/bricks/repository)
- [storage](https://github.com/geekswamp/cithakan/tree/main/bricks/storage)

## Usage

After installation, you can generate a template using the following command:

```bash
mason make <BRICK_NAME>
```

For example:

```bash
mason make bloc
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to customize the template to your project's needs.

## Dependencies Used

- [dio] is a powerful HTTP client for Dart, used for making network requests with features like interceptors, request cancellation, and automatic retries.
- [envied] is used for managing environment variables securely within the Flutter application.
- [fpdart] is a functional programming library for Dart that provides powerful monads like Either, Option, and Task to improve code safety and maintainability.
- [freezed] helps in generation immutable classes and union types, making data modeling and serialization easier.
- [flutter_secure_storage] is used for securely storing sensitive data, such as authentication tokens and user credentials, using platform-specific encrypted storage.
- [flutter_bloc] is used for state management, providing a predictable way to manage application state using the BLoC pattern.
- [get_it] is a simple yet powerful service locator for Dart, used to manage dependencies efficiently without relying on Flutterâ€™s `BuildContext`.
- [injectable] is used for dependency injection, allowing for a modular and testable codebase.
- [json_serializable] is used to automate the serialization and deserialization of JSON data, reducing boilerplate code and ensuring type safety.

## Limitation

[freezed] does not allow inheriting from its generated classes. Instead of inheritance, it is recommended to use **composition** ([source]). For example:

```dart
@freezed
class OtherParams with _$OtherParams {
  const factory OtherParams({
    required QueryParams queryParams,
  }) = _OtherParams;
}
```

## Project Structure
